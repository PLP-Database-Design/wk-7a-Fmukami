## 📚 Assignment Questions

### Question 1 Achieving 1NF (First Normal Form) 🛠️
Task:
- You are given the following table **ProductDetail**:

| OrderID | CustomerName  | Products                        |
|---------|---------------|---------------------------------|
| 101     | John Doe      | Laptop, Mouse                   |
| 102     | Jane Smith    | Tablet, Keyboard, Mouse         |
| 103     | Emily Clark   | Phone                           |


- In the table above, the **Products column** contains multiple values, which violates **1NF**.
- **Write an SQL query** to transform this table into **1NF**, ensuring that each row represents a single product for an order
- 
CREATE TABLE ProductDetail_1NF (
    OrderID INT,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(100),
  Product VARCHAR(50)
);

  INSERT INTO ProductDetail_1NF (OrderID, CustomerName, Product) VALUES
(101, 'John Doe', 'Laptop'),
(101, 'John Doe', 'Mouse'),
(102, 'Jane Smith', 'Tablet'),
(102, 'Jane Smith', 'Keyboard'),
(102, 'Jane Smith', 'Mouse'),
(103, 'Emily Clark', 'Phone');

### Question 2 Achieving 2NF (Second Normal Form) 🧩

- You are given the following table **OrderDetails**, which is already in **1NF** but still contains partial dependencies:

| OrderID | CustomerName  | Product      | Quantity |
|---------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| 101     | John Doe      | Laptop       | 2        |
| 101     | John Doe      | Mouse        | 1        |
| 102     | Jane Smith    | Tablet       | 3        |
| 102     | Jane Smith    | Keyboard     | 1        |
| 102     | Jane Smith    | Mouse        | 2        |
| 103     | Emily Clark   | Phone        | 1        |

- In the table above, the **CustomerName** column depends on **OrderID** (a partial dependency), which violates **2NF**. 

- Write an SQL query to transform this table into **2NF** by removing partial dependencies. Ensure that each non-key column fully depends on the entire primary key.
  
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE OrderItems (
    OrderID INT,
    Product VARCHAR(50),
    Quantity INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (OrderID) REFERENCES Orders(OrderID)
);

INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, CustomerName) VALUES
(101, 'John Doe'),
(102, 'Jane Smith'),
(103, 'Emily Clark');

INSERT INTO OrderItems (OrderID, Product, Quantity) VALUES
(101, 'Laptop', 2),
(101, 'Mouse', 1),
(102, 'Tablet', 3),
(102, 'Keyboard', 1),
(102, 'Mouse', 2),
(103, 'Phone', 1);
